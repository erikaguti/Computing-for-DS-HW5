# 5) Squash some bugs! 
# Find the possible logical errors (bugs) 
# in the code blocks below. Comment in each of them
# which logical errors did you find and correct them
### (a)
total_double_sum = 0
for elem in [10, 5, 2]:
    double = elem * 2
    total_double_sum += elem


# Error: the variable double should be used instead of elem 
# My assumption is that the variable total_double_sum is 
# the sum of the elements of the list doubled

# Corrected version of code:
total_double_sum = 0
for elem in [10, 5, 2]:
    double = elem * 2
    total_double_sum += double

### (b)
strings = ''
for string in ['I', 'am', 'Groot']:
    strings = string+"_"+string

# Error: the variable strings gets recreated in every iteration 
# and the output does not make syntatic sense (e.g. first output of iteration is "I_I")

#Corrected version of code:
strings = ''

for string in ['I', 'am', 'Groot']:
    strings = strings + string+ ' '
print(strings)

### (c) Careful!
j=10
while j > 0:
   j += 1

#Error: j will always be greater than 0, causing an infinite loop.

# corrected version of code:
j = 0 
while j < 10:
    j += 1
print(j)


### (d)
productory = 0
for elem in [1, 5, 25]:
    productory *= elem

# Error: productory will always be 0
# my assumption is that productory should be the product
# of the elements in the list

#corrected version of code:

for elem in [1, 5, 25]:
    elem *= elem
productory = elem
print(productory)
